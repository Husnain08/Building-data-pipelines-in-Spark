# Basic Data Preprocessing and feature engineering for machine learning using Spark

This project deals with basic data preprocessing using Spark and we build a complete end to end machine learning pipeline using Spark. We also explore how to work with SQL in PySpark and how to work with dataframes in Spark.


### Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to install
```
1. Spark
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Python 3.x
4. Pandas and Numpy 
```
